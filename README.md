## 13822 Freight Frenzy Robot Code (2022)

This project contains the robot code for Team 13822's robot in the *First Tech Challenge* 2022 season "Freight Frenzy".
It utilizes the FTCEngine, an in-house developed engine that allows for easy transfer of projects between seasons with minimal overhead. It handles the implementation of hardware and add-ons (like OpenCV) using custom methods and objects. It also tackles mecanum-wheel strafing movement and other core processes.
